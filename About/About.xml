  <Description>
        This mod allows you to write [b]Python[/b] instead of IC10. The Python code is converted into IC10 before it's written to the chip. It depends on the IC10 Editor mod, which replaces the in-game code editor. To use it, select "Python" as the language in the top right corner of the IC10 Editor window. Search for "pytrapic" in the Stationpedia for examples.

        - Save-compatible: Remove/add it any time without breaking your savegames
        - Multiplayer-compatible: Also works if you are the only one using it (untested)
        - Write code in Python instead of IC10 assembly language
        - Supports a subset of Python (see below for more details)
        - Syntax highlighting, autocomplete, hover details (via basedpyright lsp)
        - Compile errors are shown as tooltip
        - Intrinsics: all IC10 commands are available as Python function
        - Import saved libraries as python modules for easy code reusability

        [b]Installation[/b]
        This is a [b]StationeersLaunchPad[/b] Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed.
        See: https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad

        Known issues/pitfalls:
        - This the first release for the in-game mod, so there might be bugs. I you find one, don't keep it! Reach out to me via discord/github/steam.
